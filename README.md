# autoharmonizer

I'm working on an app to automatically harmonize with your voice. For now, you can play with it by cloning the repo and serving it on localhost.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/echentw/autoharmonizer.git
cd autoharmonizer/
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

and open up your web browser and enter localhost:8000 into the url box.
